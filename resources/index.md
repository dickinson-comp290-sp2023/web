<!-- ## Class 6 -->

<!-- * Main topic: FarmOS API.  -->
<!-- * There are no slides for today.  -->
<!-- * I will give a quick demo and the remainder of time will be for -->
<!--   individual meetings with the instructor to make progress on FarmData2 -->
<!--   School assignments. -->
<!-- * During the online session, you can contact me via private message or general posting on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aKwYFIGi6SM-Rh6Pvhy2LguJcDw_4TxrkzXAFidD915Q1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=64687cb3-ec94-4b9c-a2a9-9b40ebe7a2d2&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb). -->
<!-- * Starting next week, we will be working in small teams of three or -->
<!--   four students for the rest of the semester. If you have a preference -->
<!--   of who you would like to work with, please submit the [team member -->
<!--   suggestion form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=VbAyYrl2E0ybiLVirn22-2zFL4dI9oNMmoALudp-AK9UN0xERlo4VVNXVzRDUVlPMFJQU1hUUDIzQS4u). -->
<!-- * Note that the final FDS assignment is due at midnight Monday and -->
<!--   there is a reading assignment due 8 AM Wednesday. -->

## Class 14

* Today we will use class time to focus on completion of essential work.
  - Anyone who has not completed the WiD component (EPR2 Part B)
    should do so in class today.
  - We aim for every team to get their first issue merged, at a
    minimum. So far Team 2 has their first issue merged but the other
    teams do not. Please use class time to resolve all remaining
    problems with your first issue.

## Class 9

Epic teams:

| team number | team members | issue | origin repo |
|-------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Ha, Tai, James | [#160](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FD2School-FarmData2/issues/160) | origin 
| 2 | John, Wonje, Shahir | [#159](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FD2School-FarmData2/issues/159) | [origin](https://github.com/COMP290-John-Wonje-Shahir/FD2School-FarmData2) 
| 3 | Duc, Quan, Tap | [#158](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FD2School-FarmData2/issues/158) | [origin](https://github.com/QuanDucTap/FD2School-FarmData2) 

* [Slides giving overview of Epic project](class09/09-S-ProjectWork.pptx)


## Class 8

* Please complete the [mid-semester
  survey](https://forms.office.com/r/QybRnXiB6e).
* Overview of FarmData2 custom components ([slides](class08/08-S-FD2Components.pptx))
* Useful general skill: using `find` and `grep` to explore a code base.
  - I often use `find . -name "*something*"`
  - ... and `grep -r "something" *` ... and `-i` is useful to ignore case, `-l` to show filenames only


## Class 7

* Overview of end-to-end tests with Cypress ([slides](class07/07-S-Cypress.pptx))


## Class 6

* Overview of FarmOS API ([slides](class06/06-S-FarmOS-API.pptx))
* git is much easier to use if you enable tab completion. This is not
  enabled in our FarmData2 development environments by default.
  - Search online for instructions. On linux, the following may work:

	        source /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git

    in a terminal.
    On a Mac, the following worked for me:
    
                curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
                source ~/.git-completion.bash
  - To automatically enable it in every shell (i.e. terminal), add
    that command to the end of the file `~/.bashrc`.

## Class 5

* Discussion of communication in open-source software projects based on Fogel chapter 6 (homework assignment MP2).
* Overview of web API task ([slides](class05/05-S-APIs.pptx))
