# Moodle postings (MP1-MP6)

For each of these assignments, you must read the assigned reading
carefully, take notes on important points, and be ready to discuss the
content in class. You must also post at least one question worthy of
discussion to the relevant Moodle forum. Optionally, you may reply to
others' questions and post additional questions yourself.

**During discussion sessions, no use of electronic devices will be
permitted. Therefore, it is essential to bring some handwritten or
typed notes with you to class, so that you can refer to essential
information from the readings during the discussion. If you attend
more than one discussion session without bringing suitable notes, you
will be considered absent and an additional blog post will be required
(see below).**

Two of the required readings below refer to the following publication
as "Fogel": [Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful
Free Software Project](https://producingoss.com/), by Karl Fogel
(first published 2005 by O'Reilly Media; free online version updated
2019).

If you are absent from a discussion session or required event
(regardless of whether your absence is excused in advance or not), you
must still post a discussion question as described above, **and** you
must write a blog post about the reading or event. In your blog post,
discuss and respond to one or more of the questions posted by other
students. Your post should be made publicly available online somewhere
(e.g. tumblr.com). The post must be at least 800 words in
length. Submit a link to your blog post to the Moodle forum. The link
must be submitted within three days of our discussion session.
