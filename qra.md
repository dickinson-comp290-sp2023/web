# QRA (Quantitative Reasoning Associate)

We are very fortunate to have a student QRA (Quantitative Reasoning
Associate) providing extra help with this course. Our QRA is Han Trinh
(trinhha@dickinson.edu). Han will be holding office hours (Monday
9:30-10:30pm in Tome 117) to assist with homework and understanding of
course concepts, and may also be available at other times by
appointment.
